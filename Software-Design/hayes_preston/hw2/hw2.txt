HW2 Due 11:59PM September 6

In this homework we'll create an initial strategic design for a version of Game of Life.

We'll not be writing any code in this homework, but only creating an initial design.

Conway's Game of Life: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life>.

Don't worry about being right or wrong here (there is no one right
design or solution to this problem).

Don't google for answers, it is more fun to arrive at your own solutions and 
see how your thought process evolves in discussions with your pair and the reviews.

1. How would you design this program which is a GUI application? 
Draw a UML diagram for your design and refer to it from the text here.

REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR ANSWER.

2. Discuss (not just mention) what programming language you would use. 

REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR ANSWER

3. How do you plan to structure the program, what libraries would you use? Here we're looking for details about code directory structure, compilers, IDEs, tools, etc.---things that are at a higher level than the program and the programming language itself.
