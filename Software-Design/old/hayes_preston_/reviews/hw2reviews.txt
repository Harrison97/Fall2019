synopsis:  good start, let's bring in some structure and design details

details: 

Diagram:

Check in a pdf file of a diagram. The diagram may be hand drawn and scanned using a smart phone or you may use a UML diagraming tool to create it.

Text:

1.

Please start with a short paragraph that reflects the understanding of what we are about to design, tell us about the game, the constraints, what we know about it.

Then, reference a UML diagram that is in a separate file. After that, write a short paragraph describing the overall design, give a big picture. Give reasons. Then dive into, in short paragraphs, with details about each class, their purpose, and reasons we choose to design them.

2.

Many other languages can do this too, why are we choosing Python?

3.

We can get to this after we complete part 2.
