Agile Developement is Feedback driven developement.

Agile is about adaptive planning and using the feedback loops.

PMs set the scope, set the date, and tell who is going to work on it. What is the point?

If you want to save money - slow down to save speed. Spend the time writing quality tests.

Slow down and write automated tests. Don't speed up on the turn and land in the ditch.

2 benefits of tests:
    Regression Test - make sure it still works
    Design benefits. - Good design is cohesive and have less coupling.

Automated tests that run as you change code - MochaJS

Version control saves money! SEs NEED to be proficient in version control.
